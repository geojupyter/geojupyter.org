GeoJupyter is a collaboration between many communities and organizations, including but
not limited to:

* The [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) community
* [QuantStack](https://quantstack.net/)
* [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/)
* [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/)
* [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu/)
* [The Eric & Wendy Schmidt Center for Data Science and Environment at UC Berkeley](https://dse.berkeley.edu/)


## Current status: Exploration & input-gathering

[QuantStack](https://quantstack.net/) is developing
[JupyterGIS](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis), a *collaborative* GIS
environment in JupyterLab.

[DSE](https://dse.berkeley.edu/) is beginning the process of interviewing geospatial
data practitioners to inform the direction of GeoJupyter.
We are building partnerships with research, educational, and industry communities and
workshopping ideas for new user experiences.
