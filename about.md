## Current status: Idea generation and development

[QuantStack](https://quantstack.net/) is developing
[JupyterGIS](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis), a *collaborative* GIS
environment in JupyterLab.

[DSE](https://dse.berkeley.edu/) and the GeoJupyter community are distilling insights from interviewees.

The GeoJupyter community is [meeting bi-weekly](/blog/20250129-announcing-geojupyter-hackathons) to generate and develop ideas.
Please see our [hackathon notes blog posts](/blog/#category=Hackathons) to follow our progress!
