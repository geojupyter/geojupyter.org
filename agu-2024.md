## Call to action

GeoJupyter is a brand new effort started in late 2024. You can
[learn more on our "About" page](/about). What we need most right now is
input from geospatial data user communities. To help with that, please **sign up for an
interview** and/or join our real-time Zulip chat!

We are currently working to select communication tools; for now there is an open
[GitHub Discussions community space](https://github.com/orgs/geojupyter/discussions).
**We are _so_ excited to collaborate with you!** :star_struck:
