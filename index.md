GeoJupyter is a blank-slate re-envisioning of geospatial data exploration and analysis
workflows for researchers and learners.

The time has come to redesign data workflows by combining the strengths of desktop GIS
and coding based tools into an accessible, collaborative, and reproducible platform. Our
approach emphasizes creativity, playfulness, and storytelling to enable more confident
analysis and exploration of geospatial data.
