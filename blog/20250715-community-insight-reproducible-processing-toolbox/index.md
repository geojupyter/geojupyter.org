title: "Community Insight: Reproducible Processing Toolbox ðŸ§°"
description: |
  In user interviews, we found that many researchers want to work in a graphical GIS
  environment _and_ a Jupyter Notebook, and they want to come away with a unified,
  reproducible, and shareable product.

QGIS features
[an excellent **processing toolbox** of geospatial algorithms](https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/user_manual/processing/toolbox.html).
This enables researchers to access the computational power of
[GDAL/OGR](https://gdal.org/en/stable/) and other providers without needing to code.
QGIS also provides a
[model builder](https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/user_manual/processing/modeler.html)
which enables users to combine processing operations into a single reusable algorithm.
Users can even
[export those algorithms to Python scripts](https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/user_manual/processing/modeler.html#exporting-a-model-as-a-python-script)!
