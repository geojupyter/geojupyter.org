## :thought_balloon: What you can expect

### Orientation

Our Hackathon will begin with a brief orientation period.
We will have lightning introductions and add our hack ideas to a shared document.
Then we will form goals from the ideas that sound the most fun, and break into small teams.


### Hacking!

We'll work together in Zoom breakout rooms to make progress on our goals for the bulk of the hackathon.
We will save our work in GitHub as Issues or Pull Requests.
If the outcome isn't a good fit for GitHub, we'll create new topics in
the [#geojupyter Zulip channel](https://jupyter.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/471314-geojupyter).


### Sync

In the final moments, we'll ask if anyone needs help or has exciting progress to share.

Thank you!
