## :jigsaw: Need

**We believe that geospatial data analysis and exploration should be free, open source,
and accessible for everyone!**

Currently, a divide exists between two worlds: The desktop GIS world, in which QGIS and
ArcGIS provide intuitive visualization-first interfaces to exploring data; and the
programming-based GIS world which provides cutting-edge editing, reproducibility, and
publishing experiences.

Between those two worlds, users of code-based workflows face the daunting problem of a
blank page and steep learning curves, while non-programmers are missing out on the
power of code-based workflows to enable flexible alterations, version control, and
low-friction reproducibility and publishing.

GeoJupyter will comprise a new generation of tools and enhancements to existing tools
supporting exploring data about our planet. This includes tasks traditionally done
with desktop GIS applications, but also analysis pipelines that go beyond typical GIS
uses; supporting any dataset about our planet that has spatio-temporal structure, for
example climate models or subsurface data acquired with remote sensing instruments.


## :memo: Process

To achieve our goals, we will:

* Gather information about geospatial data practitioners' workflows and points of pain
  or joy.
* Establish new GeoJupyter community spaces and build new partnerships with Earth
  science and open source communities.
* Develop sacrificial concepts and prototypes to fit our work to community needs.
* Deliver high-quality software solutions, educational materials, and training sessions.


## :watch: Where is GeoJupyter now?

We have established a
[community chat space on Zulip](https://jupyter.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/471314-geojupyter/topic/Welcome)
and a [community calendar](/calendar.md).
We are currently scheduling our first series of community meetings, with many more to come.

Sponsored by the European Space Agency,
[QuantStack is leading development of JupyterGIS](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupytergis-d63b7adf9d0c)
([GitHub](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis)),
a real-time collaborative GIS environment for JupyterLab. We're
[imagining new workflows](https://jupyter.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/471314-geojupyter/topic/.22Bouncing.22.20between.20JupyterGIS.20and.20a.20Jupyter.20Notebook), and we need your creativity, knowledge, and skills!

We have completed over a dozen interviews targeting geospatial data practitioners from
diverse backgrounds, including education, data user support, Earth science, remote
sensing, software engineering, and product development.
Some themes we've preliminarily identified:

> :star_struck: It feels _amazing_ to explore data, see a completed visualization, and
> use creativity to answer questions with geospatial data!
>
> :confounded: It can be time-consuming, finnicky, and frustrating to create visualizations
> and debug geospatial data, which is notoriously "quirky".
>
> :climbing: Learning geospatial concepts and programming is hard.
> Many learners struggle without ready visual feedback.

We will follow up soon with a more comprehensive blog post about our interviews.

For early development, we have narrowed our focus on the educational user: teachers and
students. We will build partnerships with research education communities and university
classrooms as early users who will shape GeoJupyter.
