## :jigsaw: Need

**We believe that geospatial data analysis and exploration should be free, open source,
and accessible for everyone!**

Currently, a divide exists between two worlds: The desktop GIS world, in which QGIS and
ArcGIS provide intuitive visualization-first interfaces to exploring data; and the
programming-based GIS world which provides cutting-edge editing, reproducibility, and
automated publishing experiences.
While this is an oversimplified framing, it highlights contrasts to set the stage
for GeoJupyter.

Between those two worlds, users of programming-based workflows face the daunting problem
of a blank page and steep learning curves, while non-coders are missing out on the
power of programming-based workflows to enable low-friction modular reuse,
reproducibility and publishing.

GeoJupyter will consist of a new generation of tools and enhancements to existing tools
supporting exploring data about our planet. This includes tasks traditionally done with
desktop GIS applications, but also analysis pipelines that go beyond typical GIS uses;
supporting any dataset about our planet that has spatio-temporal structure, for example
climate models or subsurface data acquired with remote sensing instruments.


## :memo: Process

To achieve our goals, we will:

* Gather information about geospatial data practitioners' workflows and points of pain
  or joy.
* Establish new GeoJupyter community spaces and build new partnerships with Earth
  science and open source communities.
* Develop sacrificial concepts and prototypes to fit our work to community needs.
* Deliver high-quality software solutions, educational materials, and training sessions.


## :watch: Where is GeoJupyter now?

We have established a
[community chat space on Zulip](https://jupyter.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/471314-geojupyter/topic/Welcome)
and a [community calendar](/calendar.md).
We are currently scheduling our first series of community meetings, with many more to come.

Sponsored by the European Space Agency,
[QuantStack is leading development of JupyterGIS](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupytergis-d63b7adf9d0c)
([GitHub](https://github.com/geojupyter/jupytergis)),
a real-time collaborative GIS environment for JupyterLab. We're
[imagining new workflows](https://jupyter.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/471314-geojupyter/topic/.22Bouncing.22.20between.20JupyterGIS.20and.20a.20Jupyter.20Notebook), and we need your creativity, knowledge, and skills!

We have completed over a dozen interviews targeting geospatial data practitioners from
diverse backgrounds including education, data user support, Earth science, remote
sensing, software engineering, and product development.
Some themes we've preliminarily identified:

::::::{style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px"}

[:star_struck:]{.emoji-decoration-left}

It feels _amazing_ to explore data, see a completed visualization, and
use creativity to answer questions with geospatial data!

:::{style="display: flex"}
[:confounded:]{.emoji-decoration-left}

It can be time-consuming, finnicky, and frustrating to create visualizations
and debug geospatial data, which is notoriously "quirky".

Learning geospatial concepts and programming is hard.
Many learners benefit from immediate visual feedback.

We will follow up soon with a more comprehensive blog post about community insights.

For early development, we have narrowed our focus on the educational user: teachers and
students. We will build partnerships with research education communities and university
classrooms as early users who will shape GeoJupyter.

GeoJupyter contributors currently include
[QuantStack](https://quantstack.net/),
[2i2c](https://2i2c.org/),
[Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/),
the [Schmidt Center for Data Science and Environment](https://dse.berkeley.edu/),
members of the [UC Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu) and other university communities,
members of the [NASA Earth Science](https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/) community,
and members of the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) community.
Thank you all for your amazing contributions! :bow:
