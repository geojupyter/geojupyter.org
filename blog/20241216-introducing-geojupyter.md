## Need

**We believe that geospatial data analysis and exploration should be free, open source,
and accessible for everyone!**

Currently, a divide exists between two worlds: The desktop GIS world, in which QGIS and
ArcGIS provide intuitive visualization-first interfaces to exploring data; and the
programming-based GIS world which provides cutting-edge editing, reproducibility, and
publishing experiences.

Between those two worlds, users of code-based workflows face the daunting problem of a
blank page and too-steep learning curves, while non-programmers are missing out on the
power of code-based workflows to enable flexible alterations, version control, and
low-friction reproducibility and publishing.


## Vision

![An animation of a little girl in a white dress speaking with the caption "Â¿Por que no los dos?", meaning "Why not both?"](https://media1.tenor.com/m/cFkttZU0au8AAAAd/porque-no-los-dos-gif.gif)

We intend to create a new generation of reproducible and scriptable tools for exploring
data about our planet that may include tasks traditionally done with desktop GIS
applications, but also as part of analysis pipelines that go beyond typical GIS uses;
not just mapping, but working with any dataset about our planet that has spatio-temporal
structure, for example climate models or subsurface data acquired with remote sensing
instruments.


## Process

Standing on the shoulders of the geosciences and open source communities, we aim to
**build new tooling for exploring, manipulating, and analyzing geospatial data on top of
the foundation laid by Jupyter and JupyterLab.**

To achieve this, we will:

* Gather information about user experiences and points of pain or joy.
* Establish new GeoJupyter community spaces and build new partnerships with Earth
  science and open source communities.
* Develop software prototype(s) to find a good fit for community needs.
