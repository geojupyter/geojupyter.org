We are thrilled to announce the first GeoJupyter in-person hackathon. The working title
for this event is
[_Holy Hackaroni_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=xIL_QyoK_rQ&t=9s).
:grin:

This two-day event will occur in Boulder, Colorado on May 22-23, 2025.

_TODO: Start and end times here and in "What to expect"_
