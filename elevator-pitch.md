GeoJupyter is an open and collaborative community-driven effort to reimagine
[**geospatial interactive computing**]{class="jupyter-orange"} experiences for
education, research, and industry.

We aim to combine the **approachability** and **playfulness** of desktop GIS tools, the
**flexibility** and **reproducibility** of coding-driven GIS methods, and the
**collaborative** and **storytelling** power of Jupyter to enable more researchers,
educators, and learners to confidently engage with geospatial data.
