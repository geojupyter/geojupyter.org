GeoJupyter is a community-driven re-envisioning of <b>geospatial</b> data exploration and
analysis workflows for researchers and learners.

The time has come to redesign data workflows by combining the strengths of desktop GIS
and coding based tools into an <b>accessible</b>, <b>collaborative</b>, and
<b>reproducible</b> platform. Our approach emphasizes creativity, playfulness, and
storytelling to enable more confident analysis and exploration of geospatial data.
