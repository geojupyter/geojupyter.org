## Call to action

GeoJupyter is a brand new community-owned effort started in late 2024. You can [learn
more on our "About" page](/about).
What we need most right now is software development collaboration and input from members
of communities of geospatial data practice.

To help, please **join a hackathon**, **join our real-time Zulip chat**, and/or **sign up
for an interview**!
